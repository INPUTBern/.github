The **IN**terfaculty **P**latform for Data and Comp**UT**ational Science (INPUT) is a collaboration between the [Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM)](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch)ü¶† and the [Center for Space and Habitability (CSH)](https://www.csh.unibe.ch)ü™ê. Our aim is to foster interdisciplinary research at the interface of statistics, data science, and computational science with applications in epidemiology, medicine, and the natural sciences.

We are interested in applications of statistical and machine learning in epidemiology and use high-performance computing for simulation-based inference. A major focus of our research is infectious disease modelling and outbreak analysis.

We discuss specific research topics in our monthly [INPUT Research Meetings](https://github.com/INPUTBern/research-meetings).
