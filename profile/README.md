The **IN**terfaculty **P**latform for Data and Comp**UT**ational Science (INPUT) was a collaboration between the [Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM)](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch)ü¶† and the [Center for Space and Habitability (CSH)](https://www.csh.unibe.ch)ü™ê. Our aim was to foster interdisciplinary research at the interface of statistics, data science, and computational science with applications in epidemiology, medicine, and the natural sciences.

We were interested in applications of statistical and machine learning in epidemiology and used high-performance computing for simulation-based inference. A major focus of our research was infectious disease modelling and outbreak analysis.

We discussed specific research topics in our monthly [INPUT Research Meetings](https://github.com/INPUTBern/research-meetings).
